# Siamese Graph Similarity Networks

This is the repository for the course project "Siamese Graph Similarity Networks" by Jonathan Geuter for APMTH220.

To reproduce the results, simply run the ```train.py``` file. By default, this runs the experiments for the AIDS dataset. To change to the alchemy dataset (or another dataset), change the 'dataset' entry in the config file.
